## Known Issues
**Known Issue** : Background Color on Save

**-Description** : When saving a painting, users may observe that the background color is consistently rendered as black. This issue arises due to a current limitation in the saving functionality of Art Studio.

**-Technical Details**: The current implementation of the save feature does not retain the background color set during the painting session. As a result, the default background color, which is black, is applied to the saved image.

**-Recommended Action**: As of now, a comprehensive solution to preserve the background color during the saving process is under consideration. I’m actively working on implementing a fix for this issue.

**-Temporary Workaround**: To retain the desired background color in the saved image, consider using external image editing tools after downloading the file.
